# Cricket_Score_Prediction

 Here's a summary of what I've done:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Removed unwanted columns.
Filtered out inconsistent teams.
Removed the first 5 overs data in every match.
Converted the 'date' column to a datetime object.
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the data into training and testing sets based on the year.
Trained a Linear Regression model.
Trained Ridge Regression using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Trained Lasso Regression using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation Metrics:

Checked the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization:

Plotted a distribution plot for the residuals of the Ridge and Lasso regression models.
Pickling the Model:

Saved the trained Linear Regression model using pickle.

Here are some are potential improvements for your cricket score prediction model:

Feature Engineering:

Explore additional features that might impact the cricket scores, such as player statistics, team performance in recent matches, or historical match statistics.
Model Selection:

Experiment with different regression models beyond linear regression, ridge, and lasso. Ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting might capture complex relationships in the data.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Further fine-tune the hyperparameters of your models, especially for Ridge and Lasso regression, to achieve better performance.
Handling Convergence Issues:

Investigate the convergence warnings received during Ridge and Lasso regression training. It might be necessary to adjust parameters like the maximum number of iterations or regularization strength.
Cross-Validation Strategy:

Implement a robust cross-validation strategy for model evaluation to ensure the generalization performance is reliable. Consider using TimeSeriesSplit for time-based data.
Outlier Handling:

Check for and handle outliers in the dataset, as they can significantly impact the performance of regression models.
Visualization and Interpretability:

Create visualizations to interpret the coefficients of your features and understand their impact on the predicted scores. This can provide insights into which features are more influential.
Domain Knowledge:

Incorporate cricket-specific domain knowledge into your model. For example, consider the impact of certain players, match venues, or specific opposition teams on the scores.
Ensemble Models:

Consider creating an ensemble of different models. Combining the predictions of multiple models often leads to improved overall performance.
Model Deployment:

If applicable, deploy your trained model in a real-world setting. You can use frameworks like Flask or Django to create a web application where users can input match details and get score predictions.
Feedback Loop:

If possible, establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the model. Collect data on actual match outcomes and update the model periodically for better predictions.
Documentation:

Provide detailed documentation for your code and model. This includes explanations of feature engineering choices, hyperparameter settings, and any considerations made during the development process.
